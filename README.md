A simple Python script for brute-forcing SSH credentials using a wordlists.

## Features


- Prompts for hostname, username, and wordlist path
- Attempts SSH login for each password in the wordlist
- Reports success or failure for each attempt

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jrdevadattan/ssh-jr.git
    cd ssh-jr
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your wordlist:**  
   You can find the wordlist resouces below.

2. **Run the script:**

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Follow the prompts:**

    - Enter the target hostname or IP
    - Enter the username
    - Enter the path to your wordlist file

## Example

```
Enter hostname or IP: 192.168.1.10
Enter username: admin
Enter path to wordlist file: rockyou.txt
```

- [Weakpass](https://weakpass.com/)
- [rockyou.txt (SecLists)](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz)

## Future Plans

- Add threading to make brute-force faster
- Optimize performance for large wordlists
- More logging and reporting features
